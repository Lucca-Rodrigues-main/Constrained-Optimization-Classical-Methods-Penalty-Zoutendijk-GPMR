# Constrained-Optimization-Classical-Methods-Penalty-Zoutendijk-GPMR
This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts that implement some of the classical optimization methods for constrained optimization models: Penalty and Barrier methods, linear and non-linear Zoutendijk and also the Gradient Projection Method of Rosen (GMPR).
